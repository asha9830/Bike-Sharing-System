# What I have done?
  In this study, we use the available independent variables to model the demand for shared bikes. The management will use it to determine precisely how the needs change with changing features. They can adjust their business approach in accordance with demand levels and client expectations. The model will also help management better grasp the dynamics of demand in a new market. 
   This study employs machine learning regression techniques to analyse a model for predicting the levels of demand for shared bikes. In this work, the algorithms of Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are applied and contrasted.
    PySpark was used for big data analytics and machine learning. Tableau and the Python libraries pyspark, pandas, vectorAssembler, and Pipeline were used to create the visualisations. Gradient Boosting Trees fared better than other models, according to the results.
